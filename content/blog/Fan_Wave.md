Agentic DevOps from the ground up
- Agents
- CICD
Github ---> Github Action ---> Azure Static Web App


## The Challenge
Over the Thanksgiving break i took the opportunity to take a real deep dive to see how far can i take vibe coding to get to a usesable proof of concept app. The timing was perfect as GitHub had just started their GitHub Game Off 2025 https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2025

Rules were simple put code in a public github repo and submitted before December 1st through itch.io.

## Meet The Team
- The DevOps Agent
- The Documentation Agent
- The Test and QA Agent
## Being Decriptive
The are of story telling is so import when comes to working with Agents.
