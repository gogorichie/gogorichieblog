In 2022, I had a fantastic year of reconnecting with my passions, meeting new individuals, delivering presentations, and gaining knowledge from experienced professionals. To conclude my travels and speaking engagements for the year, I had the privilege of journeying to Florida and delivering a talk at [DevOps Days Tampa](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-tampa/welcome/). Having attended DevOps conferences for many years, I was thrilled to create an engaging presentation that encouraged collaboration and prompted attendees to reflect on critical considerations when preparing for on-call duties.

As I've previously stated, each DevOps Days conference is organized independently by local hosts, resulting in each event having its unique characteristics. My favorite aspect of Tampa's event is the presence of two tracks, namely DevOps and Security. The key lessons I learned from the conference centered on Azure DevOps and Github, emphasizing the significance of incorporating security measures from the onset by utilizing these tools to Shift Security Left. During the event, I was introduced to a new tool, the Cred Scan plugin for Azure DevOps, which was a noteworthy first-time encounter for me.
