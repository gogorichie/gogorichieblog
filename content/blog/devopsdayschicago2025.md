If you’re a developer, DevOps Engineer, Operations Engineer, SRE, or anyone passionate about improving collaboration in tech, then [DevOpsDays Chicago 2025](https://devopsdays.org/events/2025-chicago/welcome/) is the conference you don’t want to miss. Having attended DevOpsDays in 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023—and even speaking in 2022 I can confidently say that this event is one of the best opportunities to grow your skills, connect with peers, and stay ahead of industry trends.



The DevOpsDays Experience
DevOpsDays is not your typical tech conference. It blends expert-led talks with interactive Open Spaces that encourage deep discussions and real-world problem-solving. Unlike conferences that feel like one-way information dumps, DevOpsDays fosters a genuine community atmosphere where everyone’s voice matters. It’s a mix of structured learning, networking, and freeform discussions that you won’t find at many other industry events.

**1. Learn from Top Industry Experts**

Each year, DevOpsDays Chicago brings together some of the brightest minds in DevOps, SRE, and platform engineering. The 2025 lineup is already shaping up to be packed with insightful talks, covering everything from SRE best practices to cutting-edge AI in DevOps. Past speakers have tackled topics like infrastructure as code (IaC), incident response, and the ever-evolving role of DevOps engineers.

**2. Engage in Meaningful Open Spaces**

One of my favorite parts of DevOpsDays has always been the Open Spaces. Unlike pre-planned sessions, Open Spaces are discussions driven by attendees. In past years, I’ve joined conversations about everything from security in the software supply chain to the blurred lines between SRE and DevOps roles. These spaces allow you to dig into real-world challenges, share your experiences, and gain insights from others in the field.

**3. Networking that Actually Matters**

Attending DevOpsDays in person is a game-changer, especially after years of virtual events. As an extrovert, I thrive on meeting new people, and DevOpsDays has been an excellent place to reconnect with past colleagues, meet industry peers, and even form business partnerships. Whether you’re chatting with vendors about their latest tools or swapping war stories with fellow engineers, the connections you make here can last far beyond the conference.

**4. Actionable Takeaways for Your Organization**

Every year, I leave DevOpsDays with new ideas to bring back to my teams. Whether it's learning about better documentation practices, improving incident management strategies, or exploring emerging DevOps tooling, there’s always something practical to implement. For example, in 2022, I spoke about handling outages while staying calm—an experience that reinforced how important psychological resilience is during high-pressure incidents.

**5. Chicago-Specific Insights**

Each DevOpsDays location has a unique flavor, and Chicago is no exception we will be at Willis Tower the artist formally known as the Sears Tower. Given the city’s strong presence in finance, logistics, tech, and retail, the discussions often focus on solving challenges specific to these industries. You’ll hear firsthand how companies are tackling DevOps challenges in these high-stakes environments, making the conference incredibly relevant if you work in—or want to break into—these sectors.

**6. A Fun and Inclusive Atmosphere**

DevOpsDays Chicago is one of the most welcoming conferences I’ve attended. The organizers prioritize accessibility, continuous feedback, and an inclusive experience for all attendees. From the Code of Conduct reviews each morning to the captioning of talks, every effort is made to ensure that everyone can participate fully. Plus, where else can you attend a tech talk and have a vendor literally give away $100 cash just for checking out their demo?
