I started automating my home last December. I needed to replace some ceiling lights and found the OSRAM lightify pretty cheap so I bought two. Since in that room I only have a floor light I picked up a third bulb and the OSRAM lightify hub too. I tied them all together with my Amazon Echo and I was off and rolling. Added in a couple of Wemo devices which I tied into the Echo as well.  Fast forward to six months later  I'm at 7 lights, 1 wall switch, and 1 outlet switch.

In the summer of 2017 I bought a Smartthings hub this gave me the ability to grow beyond the OSRAM products to a wide range of devices.

Bridging everything together. The next thing added was Belkin Wemo switches. these were great as they added the abiltiy to control
