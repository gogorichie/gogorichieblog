Another #Meme 15 topic brought you by MVP Jason Strate ([Blog](http://www.jasonstrate.com/) | [twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/stratesql)). This month topic _"What are ten blogs that you think other SQL Server professionals should be following but might not be?"_ Coming up with a list of just 10 is harder than I thought narrowing it down to ten is just way to hard but i was able to do. The list I  put together covers everyone from the newbie to SQL to the all-round DBA.
