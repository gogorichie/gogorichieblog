20+ year IT veteran, with a background in process improvement through automation. I've had the privilege of working in Operations and Development areas of IT shops sizing from Startups to Fortune 500 companies. Along the way learning from the best while doing it. What drives me is my to passion to keep learning new things, help people through educating them on best practices and uses of new technologies, and contributing to a worthwhile cause. Outside of work I volunteer with an organization called Junior Chamber International (JCI) I’ve served many years on their executive board.

You can find me regularly speaking and attending user groups in the greater Chicagoland area. I love talking about Observability, Cloud Migration, DevOps transformation among many other things.
